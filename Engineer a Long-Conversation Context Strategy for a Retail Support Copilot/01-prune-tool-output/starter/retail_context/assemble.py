"""Position-aware context assembly.

Layout (top → bottom):
  # Case Facts                       — top boundary, structured (≤ 600 tokens)
  # Resolved: Refund inquiry         — middle, compressible zone (≤ 500 tokens)
  # Resolved: Subscription cancellation — middle, compressible zone (≤ 500 tokens)
  # Active issue: Payment-method update — bottom boundary, byte-exact verbatim

This places key findings at both context boundaries (Case Facts at top, the
active turn-by-turn at bottom against the new user turn) and lets the resolved
narrative occupy the lower-attention middle. Sections are exclusive — no
interleaving.
